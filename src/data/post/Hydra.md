**Hydra**, also called the **Lernean Hydra**.

In Greek legend, the offspring of **Typhon** and **Echidna** (according to the early Greek poet Hesiod’s Theogony), a gigantic water-snake-like monster with nine heads (the number varies), one of which was immortal. The monster’s haunt was the marshes of Lerna, near **Árgos**, from which he periodically emerged to harry the people and livestock of Lerna. 

Anyone who attempted to behead the Hydra found that as soon as one head was cut off, two more heads would emerge from the fresh wound.
